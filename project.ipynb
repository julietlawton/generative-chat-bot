Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He insults him all the time. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Excellent! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What's good about that? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It makes life spicy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What does he do--of an athletic nature? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me some true stories about Dad. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: \"Dad?\"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: England? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh hell. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Dad was never in England? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\" \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"The sting.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"The sting.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me that. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me that!  Tell me that! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Wow. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Mhravitch. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Uck. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't know. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Go on. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where did you get the poison? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\" \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>&lt;AGENT&gt;: Go ahead--punch. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Punch? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: We're going right ahead with--*what*? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I know--but you--you're going to help. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Right. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, but this one is so simple. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I see. *This* one is so simple-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And with your help-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, just a day-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A *day*! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Tonight. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: How? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Committee, huh? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Committee. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes, I see that. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Good. Where are we? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Some committee's got it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Calendar? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What's that? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The Steering Committee. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Do you really think we're getting anywhere. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: *This* is. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We're over in the House. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I said--shall we get started *now* or-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil? \\n</td>\n",

Did you kill anybody? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A few cops. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No real people? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Uh-uh, just cops. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Could you believe Mr. Blonde? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Did ya see what happened to anybody else? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What do you think? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Nope. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How can you be so sure? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I got the diamonds. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I got 'em, all right? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where? Are they out in the car? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That was the plan, we meet here. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No shit? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: For all I know, you're the rat. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Look, asshole, I'm right!

You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm not pregnant. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And you said yes? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well... kind of, sort of? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How do you know that? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So you're really getting married? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: No, you're not really getting married? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How like her. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Thanks for the vote of confidence. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Was I right? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And you came here to what? To comfort me? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: But you were. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm giving him his ring back. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sang? His name is a past tense? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Stop it. He's a nice guy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I just told you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: There's more, isn't there? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me I don't have something to do with it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You don't have anything to do with it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You lie. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Look how full of yourself you are. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Jesus, you're caustic. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Good. Stay in that frame of mind. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: But can we date? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: We could introduce them. They might hit it off. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're serious. You want to date again. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You work in a market, all right. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Let me take you out tonight. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You mean, on a date? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You have a better suggestion? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I hear that's a rather popular date. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What about Sing? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Sang. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sang. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: He's not invited. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He's your fiancé. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So what are you saying? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're such an asshole. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm just kidding. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I can already tell this isn't going to work. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Who doesn't? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What happened to the walk and the nakedness? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome. \\n</td>\n",

You said... I thought you were never getting out? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Well.... huh ... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Ooohh.... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Oh... huh ... how you feeling? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm really shakey. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah.  It was terrible. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So... that sure is something. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah.  So how are you? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah... I know. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What are you talking about? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't know what I'm doing. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm sorry... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What trip? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're crazy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're really crazy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I know! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Where you gonna go? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why you going to Algeria? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What am I supposed to do? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't know... you could have picked a better place. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Denmark?  Sweden? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I like that... yeah! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in? \\n</td>\n",

Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hit was right thoughty of her. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: All right then. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You know that girl I told you about. The one I love. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah, I recollect it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: If you want me to. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: They ort to. You're a good boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Naw. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do you mean? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pull on your works. Your privates. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, jackin' off? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes sir. You ort not know that language. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You ort not to pull on yourself that away. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He ain't no count. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't reckon I know. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Naw. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why not? It died? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: So it died when it come out? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It was alive? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes sir. Right then it was. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: A boy or girl? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A little ol' boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You threw it in a trash barrel? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It was still alive when you buried it? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I heared it cryin' a little through that box. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes sir, I reckon it does. \\n</td>\n",

If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father? \\n<USER>: Man and boy. \\n<AGENT>: Everybody says he was so brave. \\n<USER>: Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said? \\n<AGENT>: He worships Father. \\n<USER>: Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper? \\n<AGENT>: He's a vacuum cleaner salesman. \\n<USER>: I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- \\n<AGENT>: She met him at college. \\n<USER>: College! \\n<AGENT>: They were in the same creative writing class. \\n<USER>: College? \\n<AGENT>: She has a master's degree in English literature. \\n<USER>: What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? \\n<AGENT>: He insults him all the time. \\n<USER>: Excellent! \\n<AGENT>: What's good about that? \\n<USER>: It makes life spicy. \\n<AGENT>: He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time? \\n<USER>: No. \\n<AGENT>: \"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\" \\n<USER>: What does he do--of an athletic nature? \\n<AGENT>: Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. \\n<USER>: Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. \\n<AGENT>: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father? \\n<USER>: Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me some true stories about Dad. \\n<USER>: \"Dad?\"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. \\n<AGENT>: England? \\n<USER>: Oh hell. \\n<AGENT>: Dad was never in England? \\n<USER>: Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\" \\n<AGENT>: \"The sting.\" \\n<USER>: As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. \\n<AGENT>: \"The sting.\" \\n<USER>: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me that. \\n<USER>: I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me that!  Tell me that! \\n<USER>: Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. \\n<AGENT>: Wow. \\n<USER>: We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! \\n<AGENT>: Mhravitch. \\n<USER>: We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. \\n<AGENT>: Uck. \\n<USER>: Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? \\n<AGENT>: I don't know. \\n<USER>: The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? \\n<AGENT>: Go on. \\n<USER>: We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. \\n<AGENT>: Where did you get the poison? \\n<USER>: We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. \\n<AGENT>: And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\" \\n   \n",

Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! \\n<AGENT>: We're going right ahead with--*what*? \\n<USER>: Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp... \\n<AGENT>: One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*? \\n<USER>: Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself-- \\n<AGENT>: Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you? \\n<USER>: Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- \\n<AGENT>: My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed? \\n<USER>: I know--but you--you're going to help. \\n<AGENT>: If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right? \\n<USER>: Right. \\n<AGENT>: Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time-- \\n<USER>: Oh, but this one is so simple. \\n<AGENT>: I see. *This* one is so simple-- \\n<USER>: And with your help-- \\n<AGENT>: Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days-- \\n<USER>: Oh, just a day-- \\n<AGENT>: A *day*! \\n<USER>: Tonight. \\n<AGENT>: Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--! \\n<USER>: Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going-- \\n<AGENT>: Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it-- \\n<USER>: How? \\n<AGENT>: You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- \\n<USER>: Committee, huh? \\n<AGENT>: Committee. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get? \\n<USER>: Yes, I see that. \\n<AGENT>: Good. Where are we? \\n<USER>: Some committee's got it. \\n<AGENT>: Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar-- \\n<USER>: Calendar? \\n<AGENT>: That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be-- \\n<USER>: What's that? \\n<AGENT>: What? \\n<USER>: The Steering Committee. \\n<AGENT>: Do you really think we're getting anywhere. \\n<USER>: Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee? \\n<AGENT>: A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list-- \\n<USER>: *This* is. \\n<AGENT>: Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now? \\n<USER>: We're over in the House. \\n<AGENT>: Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator? \\n<USER>: Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? \\n<AGENT>: Pardon? \\n<USER>: I said--shall we get started *now* or-- \\n<AGENT>: Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil? \\n   \n",

Did you kill anybody? \\n<AGENT>: A few cops. \\n<USER>: No real people? \\n<AGENT>: Uh-uh, just cops. \\n<USER>: Could you believe Mr. Blonde? \\n<AGENT>: That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? \\n<USER>: I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way. \\n<AGENT>: That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? \\n<USER>: I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody. \\n<AGENT>: What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one? \\n<USER>: Did ya see what happened to anybody else? \\n<AGENT>: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. \\n<USER>: At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back. \\n<AGENT>: What do you think? \\n<USER>: What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em. \\n<AGENT>: Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. \\n<USER>: Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they? \\n<AGENT>: You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - \\n<USER>: Nope. \\n<AGENT>: How can you be so sure? \\n<USER>: I got the diamonds. \\n<AGENT>: Where? \\n<USER>: I got 'em, all right? \\n<AGENT>: Where? Are they out in the car? \\n<USER>: No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. \\n<AGENT>: That was the plan, we meet here. \\n<USER>: Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute. \\n<AGENT>: I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. \\n<USER>: What? \\n<AGENT>: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. \\n<USER>: No shit? \\n<AGENT>: Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. \\n<USER>: So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. \\n<AGENT>: I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. \\n<USER>: Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. \\n<AGENT>: For all I know, you're the rat. \\n<USER>: Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat. \\n<AGENT>: That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat. \\n<USER>: Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull? \\n   \n",
       "42477  <USER>: You're just going to lock the store like that? \\n<AGENT>: I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed. \\n<USER>: You saw it? \\n<AGENT>: Very dramatic, I thought. \\n<USER>: It's not what you think. \\n<AGENT>: What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? \\n<USER>: I'm not pregnant. \\n<AGENT>: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? \\n<USER>: I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. \\n<AGENT>: You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. \\n<USER>: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... \\n<AGENT>: And you said yes? \\n<USER>: Well... kind of, sort of? \\n<AGENT>: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? \\n<USER>: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. \\n<AGENT>: How do you know that? \\n<USER>: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. \\n<AGENT>: So you're really getting married? \\n<USER>: No. \\n<AGENT>: No, you're not really getting married? \\n<USER>: The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. \\n<AGENT>: How like her. \\n<USER>: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. \\n<AGENT>: Thanks for the vote of confidence. \\n<USER>: Was I right? \\n<AGENT>: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. \\n<USER>: I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? \\n<AGENT>: And you came here to what? To comfort me? \\n<USER>: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. \\n<AGENT>: But you were. \\n<USER>: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. \\n<USER>: I'm giving him his ring back. \\n<AGENT>: What? \\n<USER>: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... \\n<AGENT>: Sang? His name is a past tense? \\n<USER>: Stop it. He's a nice guy. \\n<AGENT>: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? \\n<USER>: I just told you. \\n<AGENT>: There's more, isn't there? \\n<USER>: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? \\n<AGENT>: Tell me I don't have something to do with it. \\n<USER>: You don't have anything to do with it. \\n<AGENT>: You lie. \\n<USER>: Look how full of yourself you are. \\n<AGENT>: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. \\n<USER>: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? \\n<AGENT>: Jesus, you're caustic. \\n<USER>: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. \\n<AGENT>: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. \\n<USER>: Good. Stay in that frame of mind. \\n<AGENT>: But can we date? \\n<USER>: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. \\n<AGENT>: We could introduce them. They might hit it off. \\n<USER>: You're serious. You want to date again. \\n<AGENT>: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. \\n<USER>: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. \\n<AGENT>: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... \\n<USER>: You work in a market, all right. \\n<AGENT>: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. \\n<USER>: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. \\n<AGENT>: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? \\n<USER>: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. \\n<AGENT>: Let me take you out tonight. \\n<USER>: You mean, on a date? \\n<AGENT>: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. \\n<USER>: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. \\n<AGENT>: You have a better suggestion? \\n<USER>: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? \\n<AGENT>: I hear that's a rather popular date. \\n<USER>: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. \\n<AGENT>: What about Sing? \\n<USER>: Sang. \\n<AGENT>: Sang. \\n<USER>: He's not invited. \\n<AGENT>: He's your fiancé. \\n<USER>: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. \\n<AGENT>: So what are you saying? \\n<USER>: You're such an asshole. \\n<AGENT>: I'm just kidding. \\n<USER>: I can already tell this isn't going to work. \\n<AGENT>: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. \\n<USER>: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. \\n<AGENT>: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. \\n<USER>: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. \\n<AGENT>: Who doesn't? \\n<USER>: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. \\n<AGENT>: What happened to the walk and the nakedness? \\n<USER>: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome. \\n   \n",

Hello, Leon. \\n<USER>: Hello, Sonny. \\n<AGENT>: How are you doing? \\n<USER>: Well... I'm out of the hospital. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out? \\n<USER>: I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you. \\n<AGENT>: Well.... huh ... \\n<USER>: Ooohh.... \\n<AGENT>: Oh... huh ... how you feeling? \\n<USER>: I'm really shakey. \\n<AGENT>: Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. \\n<USER>: Yeah.  It was terrible. \\n<AGENT>: That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. \\n<USER>: You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? \\n<AGENT>: Yeah... \\n<USER>: You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. \\n<AGENT>: So... that sure is something. \\n<USER>: Yeah.  So how are you? \\n<AGENT>: Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! \\n<USER>: Yeah... I know. \\n<AGENT>: I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying. \\n<USER>: What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? \\n<AGENT>: What are you talking about? \\n<USER>: What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? \\n<AGENT>: Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. \\n<USER>: No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... \\n<AGENT>: I don't know what I'm doing. \\n<USER>: Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! \\n<AGENT>: I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? \\n<USER>: I'm sorry... \\n<AGENT>: I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. \\n<USER>: But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. \\n<AGENT>: All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. \\n<USER>: Well... \\n<AGENT>: I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... \\n<USER>: What trip? \\n<AGENT>: I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. \\n<USER>: I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? \\n<AGENT>: I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man! \\n<USER>: You're crazy. \\n<AGENT>: That's it. \\n<USER>: You're really crazy. \\n<AGENT>: I know! \\n<USER>: Where you gonna go? \\n<AGENT>: Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria. \\n<USER>: Why you going to Algeria? \\n<AGENT>: Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. \\n<USER>: Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped! \\n<AGENT>: I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! \\n<USER>: God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there. \\n<AGENT>: What am I supposed to do? \\n<USER>: I don't know... you could have picked a better place. \\n<AGENT>: Denmark?  Sweden? \\n<USER>: I like that... yeah! \\n<AGENT>: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in? \\n   \n",

Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy. \\n<USER>: Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers. \\n<AGENT>: Hit was right thoughty of her. \\n<USER>: I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. \\n<AGENT>: All right then. \\n<USER>: You know that girl I told you about. The one I love. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah, I recollect it. \\n<USER>: Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you. \\n<AGENT>: If you want me to. \\n<USER>: I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store. \\n<AGENT>: I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. \\n<USER>: I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me? \\n<AGENT>: They ort to. You're a good boy. \\n<USER>: Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. \\n<AGENT>: Naw. \\n<USER>: And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. \\n<AGENT>: That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? \\n<USER>: What do you mean? \\n<AGENT>: Pull on your works. Your privates. \\n<USER>: Oh, jackin' off? \\n<AGENT>: Yes sir. You ort not know that language. \\n<USER>: I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? \\n<AGENT>: You ort not to pull on yourself that away. \\n<USER>: I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her. \\n<AGENT>: He ain't no count. \\n<USER>: You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you. \\n<AGENT>: I don't reckon I know. \\n<USER>: And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me? \\n<AGENT>: Naw. \\n<USER>: 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with? \\n<AGENT>: I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with. \\n<USER>: Why not? It died? \\n<AGENT>: Yeah. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with. \\n<USER>: So it died when it come out? \\n<AGENT>: My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel. \\n<USER>: It was alive? \\n<AGENT>: Yes sir. Right then it was. \\n<USER>: A boy or girl? \\n<AGENT>: A little ol' boy. \\n<USER>: You threw it in a trash barrel? \\n<AGENT>: I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon. \\n<USER>: It was still alive when you buried it? \\n<AGENT>: I heared it cryin' a little through that box. \\n<USER>: That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother. \\n<AGENT>: I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow. \\n<USER>: That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'. \\n<AGENT>: Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out. \\n<USER>: I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did? \\n<AGENT>: I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades. \\n<USER>: Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too. \\n<AGENT>: Yes sir, I reckon it does. \\n   \n",

If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Man and boy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Everybody says he was so brave. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He worships Father. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He's a vacuum cleaner salesman. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: She met him at college. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: College! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: They were in the same creative writing class. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: College? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: She has a master's degree in English literature. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He insults him all the time. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Excellent! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What's good about that? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It makes life spicy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What does he do--of an athletic nature? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me some true stories about Dad. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: \"Dad?\"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: England? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh hell. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Dad was never in England? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\" \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"The sting.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: \"The sting.\" \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me that. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me that!  Tell me that! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Wow. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Mhravitch. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Uck. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't know. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Go on. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where did you get the poison? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\" \\n</td>\n",

Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: We're going right ahead with--*what*? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I know--but you--you're going to help. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Right. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, but this one is so simple. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I see. *This* one is so simple-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And with your help-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, just a day-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A *day*! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Tonight. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: How? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Committee, huh? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Committee. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes, I see that. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Good. Where are we? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Some committee's got it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Calendar? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What's that? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The Steering Committee. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Do you really think we're getting anywhere. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list-- \\n&lt;USER&gt;: *This* is. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: We're over in the House. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pardon? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I said--shall we get started *now* or-- \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes--sure. Why not?

But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation.

You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Did ya see what happened to anybody else? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What do you think? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Nope. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How can you be so sure? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I got the diamonds. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I got 'em, all right? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Where? Are they out in the car? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That was the plan, we meet here. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No shit? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: For all I know, you're the rat. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Now you're using your head.

       "      <td>&lt;USER&gt;: You're just going to lock the store like that? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You saw it? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Very dramatic, I thought. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It's not what you think. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm not pregnant. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And you said yes? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well... kind of, sort of? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How do you know that? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So you're really getting married? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: No, you're not really getting married? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: How like her. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Thanks for the vote of confidence. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Was I right? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: And you came here to what? To comfort me? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: But you were. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm giving him his ring back. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sang? His name is a past tense? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Stop it. He's a nice guy. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I just told you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: There's more, isn't there? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Tell me I don't have something to do with it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You don't have anything to do with it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You lie. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Look how full of yourself you are. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Jesus, you're caustic. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Good. Stay in that frame of mind. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: But can we date? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: We could introduce them. They might hit it off. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're serious. You want to date again. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You work in a market, all right. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Let me take you out tonight. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You mean, on a date? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You have a better suggestion? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I hear that's a rather popular date. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What about Sing? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Sang. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sang. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: He's not invited. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He's your fiancé. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So what are you saying? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're such an asshole. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm just kidding. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I can already tell this isn't going to work. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Who doesn't? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What happened to the walk and the nakedness? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome. \\n</td>\n",

It was terrible. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.

You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: So... that sure is something. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah.  So how are you? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Fine, thank you.

What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What are you talking about? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't know what I'm doing. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm sorry... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Well... \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What trip? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.

I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why you going to Algeria? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! \\n&lt;USER&gt;: God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: What am I supposed to do? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I don't know... you could have picked a better place. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Denmark?  Sweden? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I like that... yeah! \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!

Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hit was right thoughty of her. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: All right then. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You know that girl I told you about. The one I love. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah, I recollect it. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Would you go see her with me?

I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: They ort to. You're a good boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Naw. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? \\n&lt;USER&gt;: What do you mean? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Pull on your works. Your privates. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Oh, jackin' off? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes sir. You ort not know that language. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: You ort not to pull on yourself that away. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: He ain't no count. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I don't reckon I know. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Naw. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why not? It died? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yeah. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: Why? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: So it died when it come out? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It was alive? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Yes sir. Right then it was. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: A boy or girl? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: A little ol' boy. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: You threw it in a trash barrel? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: It was still alive when you buried it? \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I heared it cryin' a little through that box. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow. \\n&lt;USER&gt;: That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'. \\n&lt;AGENT&gt;: Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it.

If you're depressed, laughing doesn't help much.  When did you know my father? \\n<USER>: Man and boy. \\n<AGENT>: Everybody says he was so brave. \\n<USER>: Even this--\"Herb Shuttle\", you said? \\n<AGENT>: He worships Father. \\n<USER>: Ah!  And what sort of man is this worshiper? \\n<AGENT>: He's a vacuum cleaner salesman. \\n<USER>: I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille-- \\n<AGENT>: She met him at college. \\n<USER>: College! \\n<AGENT>: They were in the same creative writing class. \\n<USER>: College? \\n<AGENT>: She has a master's degree in English literature. \\n<USER>: What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too? \\n<AGENT>: He insults him all the time. \\n<USER>: Excellent! \\n<AGENT>: What's good about that? \\n<USER>: It makes life spicy. \\n<AGENT>: He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time? \\n<USER>: No. \\n<AGENT>: \"Harold, the Patron Saint of Taxidermy.\" \\n<USER>: What does he do--of an athletic nature? \\n<AGENT>: Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet. \\n<USER>: Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure. \\n<AGENT>: He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father? \\n<USER>: Big ones, little ones, teeny-weeny ones--just and otherwise. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me some true stories about Dad. \\n<USER>: \"Dad?\"  Dad.  The boy wants tales of derring-do. Name a country. \\n<AGENT>: England? \\n<USER>: Oh hell. \\n<AGENT>: Dad was never in England? \\n<USER>: Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him \"La Picadura\"--\"the sting.\" \\n<AGENT>: \"The sting.\" \\n<USER>: As in \"Death, where is thy sting?\" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more. \\n<AGENT>: \"The sting.\" \\n<USER>: Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me that. \\n<USER>: I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand. \\n<AGENT>: Tell me that!  Tell me that! \\n<USER>: Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia. \\n<AGENT>: Wow. \\n<USER>: We blacked our hands and faces.  At midnight we crept out of the forest and into the village.  The name of the village was Mhravitch. Remember that name! \\n<AGENT>: Mhravitch. \\n<USER>: We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound. \\n<AGENT>: Uck. \\n<USER>: Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet? \\n<AGENT>: I don't know. \\n<USER>: The story gets hairier.  Should I stop? \\n<AGENT>: Go on. \\n<USER>: We caught another Kraut alone in a back lane.  Your father choked him to death with a length of piano wire.  Your father was quite a virtuoso with piano wire.  That's nicer than a knife, isn't it--as long as you don't look at the face afterwards.  The face turns a curious shade of avocado.  I must ask the doctor why that is.  At any rate, we stole into the back of the inn, and, with the permission of the management, we poisoned the wine of six Krauts who were carousing there. \\n<AGENT>: Where did you get the poison? \\n<USER>: We carried cyanide capsules.  We were supposed to swallow them in case we were captured.  It was your father's opinion that the Krauts needed them more than we did at the time. \\n<AGENT>: And one of them was the Beast of Yugoslavia? HAROLD The Beast was upstairs, and he came running downstairs, for his men were making loud farewells and last wills and testaments--editorializing about the hospitality they had received.  And your father said to him in perfect German, which he had learned in the Spanish Civil War, \"Major, something tragic seems to have happened to your bodyguard.  I am Harold Ryan, of the United States of America.  You, I believe, are the Beast of Yugoslavia.\" \\n   \n",

Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it! \\n<AGENT>: We're going right ahead with--*what*? \\n<USER>: Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp... \\n<AGENT>: One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*? \\n<USER>: Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself-- \\n<AGENT>: Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you? \\n<USER>: Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it-- \\n<AGENT>: My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed? \\n<USER>: I know--but you--you're going to help. \\n<AGENT>: If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right? \\n<USER>: Right. \\n<AGENT>: Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time-- \\n<USER>: Oh, but this one is so simple. \\n<AGENT>: I see. *This* one is so simple-- \\n<USER>: And with your help-- \\n<AGENT>: Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days-- \\n<USER>: Oh, just a day-- \\n<AGENT>: A *day*! \\n<USER>: Tonight. \\n<AGENT>: Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--! \\n<USER>: Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, too. I thought--maybe--we could have something brought in--you know, like big executives who eat off trays. You see, we've got to light into this and get it going-- \\n<AGENT>: Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it-- \\n<USER>: How? \\n<AGENT>: You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee-- \\n<USER>: Committee, huh? \\n<AGENT>: Committee. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get? \\n<USER>: Yes, I see that. \\n<AGENT>: Good. Where are we? \\n<USER>: Some committee's got it. \\n<AGENT>: Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar-- \\n<USER>: Calendar? \\n<AGENT>: That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be-- \\n<USER>: What's that? \\n<AGENT>: What? \\n<USER>: The Steering Committee. \\n<AGENT>: Do you really think we're getting anywhere. \\n<USER>: Yes. Sure. What's a Steering Committee? \\n<AGENT>: A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list-- \\n<USER>: *This* is. \\n<AGENT>: Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now? \\n<USER>: We're over in the House. \\n<AGENT>: Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator? \\n<USER>: Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first? \\n<AGENT>: Pardon? \\n<USER>: I said--shall we get started *now* or-- \\n<AGENT>: Yes--sure. Why not?  You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil? \\n   \n",

Did you kill anybody? \\n<AGENT>: A few cops. \\n<USER>: No real people? \\n<AGENT>: Uh-uh, just cops. \\n<USER>: Could you believe Mr. Blonde? \\n<AGENT>: That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that? \\n<USER>: I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way. \\n<AGENT>: That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy? \\n<USER>: I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody. \\n<AGENT>: What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one? \\n<USER>: Did ya see what happened to anybody else? \\n<AGENT>: Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down. \\n<USER>: At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back. \\n<AGENT>: What do you think? \\n<USER>: What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em. \\n<AGENT>: Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole. \\n<USER>: Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they? \\n<AGENT>: You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a - \\n<USER>: Nope. \\n<AGENT>: How can you be so sure? \\n<USER>: I got the diamonds. \\n<AGENT>: Where? \\n<USER>: I got 'em, all right? \\n<AGENT>: Where? Are they out in the car? \\n<USER>: No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here. \\n<AGENT>: That was the plan, we meet here. \\n<USER>: Then where is everybody? I say the plan became null and void once we found out we got a rat in the house. We ain't got the slightest fuckin' idea what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue. They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin' 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place. I mean, that could be happening right now. As we speak, the cops could be in their cars, drivin' here this minute. \\n<AGENT>: I swear to god I'm fuckin' jinxed. \\n<USER>: What? \\n<AGENT>: Two jobs back, it was a four man job, we discovered one of the team was an undercover cop. \\n<USER>: No shit? \\n<AGENT>: Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it. \\n<USER>: So who's the rat this time? Mr. Blue? Mr. Blonde? Joe? It's Joe's show, he set this whole thing up. Maybe he set it up to set it up. \\n<AGENT>: I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit. \\n<USER>: Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat. \\n<AGENT>: For all I know, you're the rat. \\n<USER>: Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat. \\n<AGENT>: That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat. \\n<USER>: Look, asshole, I'm right! Somebody's a fuckin' rat. How many times do I hafta say it before it sinks in your skull? \\n   \n",
       "42477  <USER>: You're just going to lock the store like that? \\n<AGENT>: I want to talk to you about something, and I don't want to be disturbed. \\n<USER>: You saw it? \\n<AGENT>: Very dramatic, I thought. \\n<USER>: It's not what you think. \\n<AGENT>: What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child? \\n<USER>: I'm not pregnant. \\n<AGENT>: Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation? \\n<USER>: I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up. \\n<AGENT>: You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend. \\n<USER>: I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month... \\n<AGENT>: And you said yes? \\n<USER>: Well... kind of, sort of? \\n<AGENT>: Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is? \\n<USER>: I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby. \\n<AGENT>: How do you know that? \\n<USER>: Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones. \\n<AGENT>: So you're really getting married? \\n<USER>: No. \\n<AGENT>: No, you're not really getting married? \\n<USER>: The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. \\n<AGENT>: How like her. \\n<USER>: Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. \\n<AGENT>: Thanks for the vote of confidence. \\n<USER>: Was I right? \\n<AGENT>: Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. \\n<USER>: I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish? \\n<AGENT>: And you came here to what? To comfort me? \\n<USER>: The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. \\n<AGENT>: But you were. \\n<USER>: No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. \\n<USER>: I'm giving him his ring back. \\n<AGENT>: What? \\n<USER>: I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... \\n<AGENT>: Sang? His name is a past tense? \\n<USER>: Stop it. He's a nice guy. \\n<AGENT>: If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? \\n<USER>: I just told you. \\n<AGENT>: There's more, isn't there? \\n<USER>: Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? \\n<AGENT>: Tell me I don't have something to do with it. \\n<USER>: You don't have anything to do with it. \\n<AGENT>: You lie. \\n<USER>: Look how full of yourself you are. \\n<AGENT>: I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. \\n<USER>: If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? \\n<AGENT>: Jesus, you're caustic. \\n<USER>: I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. \\n<AGENT>: So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. \\n<USER>: Good. Stay in that frame of mind. \\n<AGENT>: But can we date? \\n<USER>: I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. \\n<AGENT>: We could introduce them. They might hit it off. \\n<USER>: You're serious. You want to date again. \\n<AGENT>: I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. \\n<USER>: It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. \\n<AGENT>: Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... \\n<USER>: You work in a market, all right. \\n<AGENT>: Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. \\n<USER>: The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. \\n<AGENT>: So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? \\n<USER>: I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. \\n<AGENT>: Let me take you out tonight. \\n<USER>: You mean, on a date? \\n<AGENT>: Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. \\n<USER>: The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. \\n<AGENT>: You have a better suggestion? \\n<USER>: How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? \\n<AGENT>: I hear that's a rather popular date. \\n<USER>: Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at you, succumbing to your wily charms, and you call me a slut, in so many words. \\n<AGENT>: What about Sing? \\n<USER>: Sang. \\n<AGENT>: Sang. \\n<USER>: He's not invited. \\n<AGENT>: He's your fiancé. \\n<USER>: I offer you my body and you offer me semantics? He's just a boyfriend, Dante, and in case you haven't gotten the drift of why I came all the way here from Ohio, I'm about to become single again.  And yes-let me placate your ego-you are the inspiration for this bold and momentous decision, for which I'll probably be ostracized at both school and home. You ask me who I choose, I choose you. \\n<AGENT>: So what are you saying? \\n<USER>: You're such an asshole. \\n<AGENT>: I'm just kidding. \\n<USER>: I can already tell this isn't going to work. \\n<AGENT>: I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back. \\n<USER>: Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog. \\n<AGENT>: He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note. \\n<USER>: You're too responsible. But no. I have to go home first. They don't even know I left school. And I should break the disengagement news to my mother, which is going to cause quite a row, considering she loves Sang. \\n<AGENT>: Who doesn't? \\n<USER>: Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you. \\n<AGENT>: What happened to the walk and the nakedness? \\n<USER>: I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.  See you later, handsome. \\n   \n",

Hello, Leon. \\n<USER>: Hello, Sonny. \\n<AGENT>: How are you doing? \\n<USER>: Well... I'm out of the hospital. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out? \\n<USER>: I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you. \\n<AGENT>: Well.... huh ... \\n<USER>: Ooohh.... \\n<AGENT>: Oh... huh ... how you feeling? \\n<USER>: I'm really shakey. \\n<AGENT>: Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. \\n<USER>: Yeah.  It was terrible. \\n<AGENT>: That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. \\n<USER>: You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? \\n<AGENT>: Yeah... \\n<USER>: You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. \\n<AGENT>: So... that sure is something. \\n<USER>: Yeah.  So how are you? \\n<AGENT>: Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! \\n<USER>: Yeah... I know. \\n<AGENT>: I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying. \\n<USER>: What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? \\n<AGENT>: What are you talking about? \\n<USER>: What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? \\n<AGENT>: Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. \\n<USER>: No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... \\n<AGENT>: I don't know what I'm doing. \\n<USER>: Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry! \\n<AGENT>: I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? \\n<USER>: I'm sorry... \\n<AGENT>: I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. \\n<USER>: But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. \\n<AGENT>: All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. \\n<USER>: Well... \\n<AGENT>: I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... \\n<USER>: What trip? \\n<AGENT>: I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. \\n<USER>: I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? \\n<AGENT>: I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man! \\n<USER>: You're crazy. \\n<AGENT>: That's it. \\n<USER>: You're really crazy. \\n<AGENT>: I know! \\n<USER>: Where you gonna go? \\n<AGENT>: Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria. \\n<USER>: Why you going to Algeria? \\n<AGENT>: Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for. \\n<USER>: Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped! \\n<AGENT>: I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped! \\n<USER>: God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there. \\n<AGENT>: What am I supposed to do? \\n<USER>: I don't know... you could have picked a better place. \\n<AGENT>: Denmark?  Sweden? \\n<USER>: I like that... yeah! \\n<AGENT>: Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in? \\n   \n",

Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy. \\n<USER>: Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers. \\n<AGENT>: Hit was right thoughty of her. \\n<USER>: I was wantin' to ask you somethin'. \\n<AGENT>: All right then. \\n<USER>: You know that girl I told you about. The one I love. \\n<AGENT>: Yeah, I recollect it. \\n<USER>: Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you. \\n<AGENT>: If you want me to. \\n<USER>: I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store. \\n<AGENT>: I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye. \\n<USER>: I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me? \\n<AGENT>: They ort to. You're a good boy. \\n<USER>: Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her. \\n<AGENT>: Naw. \\n<USER>: And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all. \\n<AGENT>: That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you? \\n<USER>: What do you mean? \\n<AGENT>: Pull on your works. Your privates. \\n<USER>: Oh, jackin' off? \\n<AGENT>: Yes sir. You ort not know that language. \\n<USER>: I didn't know till here while back a year or two ago when I spent the night with Ronnie Smart one time. He said just tug on your peter and think about your mama. I tried it, but I felt funny thinkin' about my mama. So, I switched over to thinkin' about his mama and then what he told me would happen, happened. It sure tingles, don't it? \\n<AGENT>: You ort not to pull on yourself that away. \\n<USER>: I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her. \\n<AGENT>: He ain't no count. \\n<USER>: You don't seem like a daddy. You seem like a brother.  Wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you don't even know 'em like what happened with me and you. \\n<AGENT>: I don't reckon I know. \\n<USER>: And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me? \\n<AGENT>: Naw. \\n<USER>: 'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with? \\n<AGENT>: I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with. \\n<USER>: Why not? It died? \\n<AGENT>: Yeah. \\n<USER>: Why? \\n<AGENT>: Hit was borned a little too early on. My mother and father made hit come too early some way or other. I reckon they changed their mind about havin' another'n. I was about six or eight year old then and they didn't care too much for me so I reckon they didn't need somethin' else to worry 'em with. \\n<USER>: So it died when it come out? \\n<AGENT>: My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel. \\n<USER>: It was alive? \\n<AGENT>: Yes sir. Right then it was. \\n<USER>: A boy or girl? \\n<AGENT>: A little ol' boy. \\n<USER>: You threw it in a trash barrel? \\n<AGENT>: I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon. \\n<USER>: It was still alive when you buried it? \\n<AGENT>: I heared it cryin' a little through that box. \\n<USER>: That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother. \\n<AGENT>: I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to care for no baby. Mama and Daddy didn't want him. They learned me to do what they told me to. These days I figure it might of been best to give him right back to the Good Lord right off the bat anyhow. \\n<USER>: That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl?
